# ES6 utilities

## What's this then?

This repo started out as a playground to experiment with new technology. Earlier commits and the typescript branch
contain mostly experiments.

## CustomEvent / Attribute
The master branch contains a basic implementation of YUI 3's excellent
[custom-event](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/event-custom/) and [attribute](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/attribute/)
components, written in ES6 / ES2015.
